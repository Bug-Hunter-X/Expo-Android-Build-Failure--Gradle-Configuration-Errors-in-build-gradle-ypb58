The corrected `build.gradle` file (build.gradle.solution) will typically address issues such as:

* **Missing dependencies:** Adding necessary dependencies to the `dependencies` block.
* **Version conflicts:** Resolving dependency version conflicts by specifying exact versions or using version ranges.
* **Incorrect configurations:** Correcting configurations like `compileSdkVersion`, `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, or other settings within the `android { ... }` block.
* **Plugin issues:** Ensuring correct versions and configurations of Gradle plugins.

The specific changes will depend on the exact error encountered, but the corrected file will include comments highlighting the changes made and the reason behind them.  Refer to the `build.gradle.solution` file for the specifics of the solution.
